Praise to my father,	Life of vengeance, a passive test,
Blessed by the water,	Until the grave, I will rest,
Black night, dark sky,	Engage the pressure until it crumbles,
The devil's cry,	The existence of lifeless black souls,

Bless me, with the,	Onward, to the sacred battlefield,
Leaf off of the tree,	Where justification and limits, are revealed,
On it, I see,	Tools of steel, in rage they conquer,
The freedom reign,	Weed out, the killing of victim's stalker,

We are falling,	The powers proven to end the madness,
The light is calling,	Upon I, take it to end the savage,
Tears inside me,	The rays of light, a truth of meaning,
Calm me down,	To my father, the blood is pleading,

Midnight, calling,	A justice rage, for all to feel,
Mist of resolving,	With innocent cries, and hatred squeals,
Crown me, with the,	The gore of evil seems to satisfy,
Pure green leaf,	When slain, and maimed, and pacified,

Bless me, with the,	My chosen torture makes me stronger,
Leaf off of the tree,	In a life that craves the hunger,
On it, I see,	A Freedom and a quest for life,
The freedom reign,	Until the end of Judgment Night,

Praise to my father,	Watch the footsteps, but never follow,
Blessed by the water,	If you want to live tomorrow,
Black night, dark sky,	Steel a soul for a second chance,
The devils cry.	But you will never become a man.
